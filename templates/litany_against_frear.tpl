**Litany against {!1}**
    
I must not {-1}. 
{.-1} is the {!1}. 
{.-1} is the {!1} that brings total {!1}. 
I will {!1} my {-1}. 
I will permit it to pass over me and through me. 
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. 
Where the {-1} has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain
